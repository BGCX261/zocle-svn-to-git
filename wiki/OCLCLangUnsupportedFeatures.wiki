  * Writes to a pointer (or arrays) of built-in types that are less than 32-bits in size (ex: char, uchar, char2, uchar2, short, ushort, and half) or to elements of a struct that are of built-in types that are less than 32-bits in size (ex: char, uchar, char2, uchar2, short and ushort) are not supported.

  * Arguments to __kernel functions in a program cannot be declared with the built-in
scalar types *bool, half, size_t, ptrdiff_t, intptr_t, and uintptr_t*.
