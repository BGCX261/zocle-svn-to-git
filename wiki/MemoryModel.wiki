  * Global Memory

This memory region permits read/write access to all work-items in all
work-groups. Work-items can read from or write to any element of a memory object.
Reads and writes to global memory may be cached depending on the capabilities of the device.

  * Constant Memory

A region of global memory that remains constant during the
execution of a kernel. The host allocates and initializes memory objects placed into
constant memory.

  * Local Memory

A memory region local to a work-group. This memory region can be
used to allocate variables that are shared by all work-items in that work-group. It may be implemented as dedicated regions of memory on the OpenCL device. Alternatively, the local memory region may be mapped onto sections of the global memory.

  * Private Memory

A region of memory private to a work-item. Variables defined in one work-item's private memory are not visible to another work-item.
